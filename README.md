## Aircraft Basics

### Aircraft Systems
Aircrafts can be broken down into specific systems.There are many different systems depending on the plane your flying but all aircrafts will have these basic systems.

- Electrical system
- Hydraulic system
- Powerplant
- Avionics
- Fuel system

### Principles of flight
The four forces acting on an aircraft are:
1. Weight
2. Lift
3. Thrust
4. Drag

In steady unaccelearted level flight lift equals weight and thrust equals drag. In normal flying if lift becomes greater than weight then the aircraft will become airborne.
