## Aircraft Basics

### Aircraft Systems
Aircrafts can be broken down into specific systems.There are many different systems depending on the plane your flying but all aircrafts will have these basic systems.

- Electrical system
- Hydraulic system
- Powerplant
- Avionics
- Fuel system

### Principles of flight
The four forces acting on an aircraft are:
1. Weight
2. Lift
3. Thrust
4. Drag

In steady unaccelearted level flight lift equals weight and thrust equals drag. If thrust becomes greater than drag the aircraft will begin moving and gain speed. If lift becomes greater than weight then the aircraft will rise and become airborne. The opposites apply so if the aircraft's weight and drag is greater than the aircraft will be slowing down and sinking towards the surface.

The three axis an aircraft rotates around are:
- Longitudnal
- Lateral
- Vertical

The ailerons, elevator, and rudder are flight controls that control the aircraft about these three axis's. Each axis and control causes the airplane to do a specific movement. The rudder/vertical axis changes the aircraft's yaw. The elevator/lateral axis changes the aircrafts pitch. Lastly the ailerons/longitudinal axis changes the aircrafts roll. In order to turn an aircraft you must not only yaw but also roll.
