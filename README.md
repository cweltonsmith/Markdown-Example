## Aircraft Basics

### Aircraft Systems
Aircrafts can be broken down into specific systems.There are many different systems depending on the plane your flying but all aircrafts will have these basic systems.

- Electrical system
- Hydraulic system
- Powerplant
- Avionics
- Fuel system

### Principles of flight
The four forces acting on an aircraft are:
1. Weight
2. Lift
3. Thrust
4. Drag

In steady unaccelearted level flight lift equals weight and thrust equals drag. If thrust becomes greater than drag the aircraft will begin moving and gain speed. If lift becomes greater than weight then the aircraft will rise and become airborne. The opposites apply so if the aircraft's weight and drag is greater than the aircraft will be slowing down and sinking towards the surface.

### Flight Controls

The three axis an aircraft rotates around are:
- Longitudnal
- Lateral
- Vertical

The ailerons, elevator, and rudder are flight controls that control the aircraft about these three axis's. Each axis and control causes the airplane to do a specific movement. The rudder/vertical axis changes the aircraft's **yaw**. The elevator/lateral axis changes the aircrafts **pitch**. Lastly the ailerons/longitudinal axis changes the aircrafts roll. In order to turn an aircraft you must not only yaw but also **roll**.

Again these are just the very basics and some of the first few things you learn when becoming involved with aiviation. 
If your looking to fly or just learn more in general about aviation here are some great sources. Dr. Rogers and Dr. Hawley are good sources as well as they have their *Private Pilot Licenses*.

[The Experimental Aircraft Association is a great source to get involved with the aviation community. They also host Oshkosh one of the worlds largest airshows and aviation enthusiasts gathering.](https://www.eaa.org/eaa)

[The Federal Aviation Administration is a great source to learn about the requirements and rules of the air.](https://www.faa.gov/pilots/become/)

[The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association is another good source to get invovled with the community and learn more about flying.](https://www.aopa.org/)
